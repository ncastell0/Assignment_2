"0","# Reflection on question 10: My intuition is that using the same data to fit the regression model and evaluate prediction accuracy might result in overestimated accuracy and lower generalizabity. Since the model was produced based on the data set, its fit to the data is optimized, and the prediction accuracy merely reproduces the relationship between variables within the observations. Even with a big and representative sample, we should expect random effects and measurement errors that could influence model fit and bias the model. In this sense, the test is not a real test, since it doesn't inform on the applicability of the model to a different set of data."
