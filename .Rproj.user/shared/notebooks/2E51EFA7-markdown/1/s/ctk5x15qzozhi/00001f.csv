"0","# Answer to question 1: The correlation between petal width and petal length is very strong and positive, close to 1. This makes sense to me, since petals tend to develop in a rounder shape and, the bigger they are, the greater both length and width tend to be. Sepal length shows a strong, positive correlation with both petal length and petal width. This indicates that larger flowers have longer sepals. However, sepal length and sepal width are negatively and weakly correlated. This could mean that, although larger flowers tend to have have longer sepals, they might in some cases not be as wide. The small magnitude of the effect, however, indicates that the relationship is not stable and there may be a large variance in the data. Finally, sepal width is negatively and moderately correlated with both petal length and petal width. The larger the petals are, the narrower their sepal. Although I don't know much about iris flowers' structure, the observed relationships between variables seem to make sense to me."
