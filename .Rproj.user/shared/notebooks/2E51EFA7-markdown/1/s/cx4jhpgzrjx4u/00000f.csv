"0","# Answer to question 6: The estimated coefficient for sepal width indicates that, if sepal width increases by 1, sepal length rises by 0.80 unit, when the variable species is accounted for. It makes more sense than assuming that sepal width and length are negatively correlated, as the correlation matrix suggests, or that they aren't linearly related, as model 1 had shown. The model is greatly improved by adding species. In model 2, both sepal width and species significantly predict sepal length (p-values < .001), and the adjusted R-squared increased from 0.01 to 0.72. The interpretation changes in the sense that, within each species, we can see a linear relationship between sepal width and length."
