"0","# Answer to question 7: The prediction appears reasonable. When width is equal to 0, predicted length is 2.2514, as indicated by the intersection estimate. The estimated coefficient for sepal width, using setosa as a reference, is 0.8036. The prediction value, 5.1442 represents precisely an increase of 0.8036 in length for each centimeter added in width."
