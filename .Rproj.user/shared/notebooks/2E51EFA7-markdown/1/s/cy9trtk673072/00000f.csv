"0","# Answer to question 3: The model indicates that, for every unit increase in sepal width, sepal length decreases by 0.22. However, the F-test didn't achieve statistical significance (p = 0.1519). That is, the hypothesis that there is not a linear relationship between these variables in the population (H0) can't be rejected. This matches what was seen in tasks 1 and 2. Task 1 showed a small negative correlation between the predictor and the outcome. Task 2 indicated that the relationship between these variables was unstable and that the variance in the data was high. In task 3, the linear model wasn't a good fit for the data. This indicates that, in fact, there is no linear relationship between sepal width and sepal length in the population."
